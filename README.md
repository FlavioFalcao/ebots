Exploring evolutionary robotics through simulation experiments.

# Experiments
## Experiment 1: Wall Follower
The objective of this experiment is to build a robot capable of following walls, but instead of creating fixed rules telling the robot what to do, we will use a more flexible evolutionary approach. [Read more...][wall-follower]

# Dependencies
  + Python 2.7
  + NumPy 1.6.2
  + matplotlib 1.2.x
  + MongoDB 2.2.0
  + PyMongo 2.3
  + Blender 2.63.a
  + MORSE 0.5.2

# How to Run
Open two separate terminal sessions and go to the `ebots/` directory. In one terminal execute `morse run stages/stage_name.py`, and in the other `python experiment-X.py`. A Blender window containing the simulation should appear.
